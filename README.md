# mini_project_challenge
Mini Project for WA


This project was attempted over the course of a week so that myself and another intern could have experience with the technologies that we contributed to during our time during the internship. This application was not meant to run in a production environment and it was meant solely to instill a large swathe of fundamentals in myself and the other intern.
